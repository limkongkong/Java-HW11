/*6.1 (Assign grades) Write a program that reads student scores, gets the best score, and
then assigns grades based on the following scheme:
Grade is A if score is best-10
Grade is B if score is best -20 ;
Grade is C if score is best -30 ;
Grade is D if score is best  -40;
Grade is F otherwise.
The program prompts the user to enter the total number of students, then prompts
the user to enter all of the scores, and concludes by displaying the grades. Here is
a sample run:*/

package System.out;
import java.util.Scanner;
public class chap6_1 {
	
	public static void result ( int numofscore [], int max){
	
	for (int i = 0; i < numofscore.length; i++){
